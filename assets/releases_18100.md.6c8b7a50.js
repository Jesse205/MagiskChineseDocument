Even though Huawei had officially blocked bootloader unlocks, people still love to buy them (duh), and there are paid services that unlock Huawei bootloaders. So hey, get Magisk installed on that bad boy! One caveat is that since Huawei have changed the partitions, special workarounds has to be done.

All devices running KitKat and higher will have all features enabled. MagiskHide and resetprop aren&#39;t possible on Jellybean, and Magic Mount (modules) is temporarily disabled; basically it only works as a root solution for now. Android 4.1 isn&#39;t 100% usable yet, so installation is also temporarily blocked. Eventually, all Jellybean devices will have full Magic Mount and MagiskSU support.</p><h3 id="major-magisk-manager-update" tabindex="-1">Major Magisk Manager Update <a class="header-anchor" href="#major-magisk-manager-update" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3><p>Aside from the obvious major UI overhaul, tons of little user experience and performance improvements are also added.
